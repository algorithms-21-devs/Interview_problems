____
## Recommeded Path
1. Read the question carefully
2. Ask your interviewer many questions. Do not Make assumptions.
3. Use a whiteboard or paper
4. Do a brute force approach
5. Improve your brute force approach. Consider improving time or space complexity even readability.
6. Check with the standard solutions posted at end of the week or those of your peers.

## Potential Questions to ask your interviewer:
  * Look [here](https://github.com/algorithms-21-devs/Interview_problems/blob/master/weekly_interview_questions/IQ_7/Q7_Extracting_Information.md) for questions you could ask for this particular question

_____
## Condition Modes
* Choose a condition mode for your solution. You can choose more than 1 if you want to submit multiple solutions.

#### Q7_Easy: Return a new list. No other restrictions.
#### Test Cases:

* your_function(Head->1->2->3->Null) returns Head->3->2->1->Null
* your_function(Head->5->48->7->Null) returns Head->7->48->5->Null
* your_function(Null) raises Exception
* your_function(Head->None) raises Exception



#### Q7_Medium: You cannot use additional data structures. You do not return a new linked list, but rather adjust the current one in place.
#### Test Cases:
* your_function(Head->1->2->3->Null) #does not return anything just changes the linked list in place to Head->7->48->5->Null
* your_function(Head->5->48->7->Null) #does not return anything just changes the linked list in place to Head->7->48->5->Null
* your_function(Null) raises Exception
* your_function(Head->None) raises Exception
