#### Test Cases:

* your_function([5,6,9,2]) returns [2,9,6,5]
* your_function([-3,4] returns [4,-3]
* your_function([0]) returns [0]
* your_function([]) returns [] or None/null(if your language restricts does not allow you to return an empty array)
* your_function(null) returns Exception



#### Q2_Medium: Negatives and positive values are both present. You cannot sort the list.
#### Test Cases:
