# Question
##### Design a stack, which has the following operations pop, push, and min. All should be in O(1) time.

____
## Recommeded Path
1. Read the question carefully
2. Ask your interviewer many questions. Do not Make assumptions.
3. Use a whiteboard or paper
4. Do a brute force approach
5. Improve your brute force approach. Consider improving time or space complexity even readability.
6. Check with the standard solutions posted at end of the week or those of your peers.

____
## Potential Questions to ask your interviewer:
  * Look [here](https://github.com/algorithms-21-devs/Interview_problems/blob/master/weekly_interview_questions/IQ_8/Q8_Extracting_Information.md) for questions you could ask for this particular question

_____
## Condition Modes
* Choose a condition mode for your solution. You can choose more than 1 if you want to submit multiple solutions.

#### Q5_Medium: No restrictions. All operations must be done in O(1) constant time.
#### Test Cases:

* my_stack.push(0) #stack has the elements 0
* my_stack.push(4) #stack has the elements 4,0
* my_stack.push(8) #stack has the elements 8,4,0
* my_stack.push(3) #stack has the elements 3,8,4,0
* my_stack.push(1) #stack has the elements 1,3,8,4,0

* my_stack.min() # returns 0

* my_stack.pop() #returns 1, stack has the elements 3,8,4,0
* my_stack.pop() #returns 3, stack has the elements 8,4,0
* my_stack.pop() #returns 8, stack has the elements 4,0
